# BiteVue (Powered by Nexus) 🧠🍎

**The AI-Native Food & Health Co-Pilot.**

BiteVue is not just a barcode scanner; it is a **reasoning engine** that overlays intelligence onto the physical world. It fuses Computer Vision, OCR, and Large Language Models (LLMs) into a seamless "See-Think-Speak" loop to help you make smarter, healthier food choices instantly.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Magic Intents**: Infers your intent from the object itself. Scans protein powder? It talks about recovery. Scans medicine? It warns about dosage.
-   **Comparative Memory**: Nexus has Object Permanence. It remembers your previous scan and actively compares products for you.
-   **AI-Native Voice**: Hands-free interaction designed for the kitchen. Smart silence detection knows when you've finished speaking.
-   **Multimodal Pipeline**: Combines Computer Vision (Nexus Eye), OCR, and LLM Analysis for a complete understanding of your food.
-   **Privacy-First**: All processing happens on-device or via secure, private channels.
